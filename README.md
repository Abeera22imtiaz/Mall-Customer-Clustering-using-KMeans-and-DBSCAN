🛍️ Mall Customer Clustering using K-Means and DBSCAN
📖 Overview

This project applies K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering algorithms to the Mall Customer Dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
The goal is to understand different customer groups and compare how both algorithms perform in identifying patterns and outliers.

🚀 Objectives

Segment mall customers into meaningful clusters.

Compare K-Means and DBSCAN performance.

Visualize clusters and analyze customer behavior.

Evaluate models using Silhouette Score.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

NumPy

📊 Methods
1. K-Means Clustering

Groups customers into a fixed number of clusters.

Uses the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.

Based on centroid distance.

2. DBSCAN Clustering

Groups customers based on density.

Automatically detects outliers (noise points).

Works well for clusters of irregular shapes.

📈 Results

K-Means created clear, evenly shaped clusters.

DBSCAN identified noise and more natural groupings.

Silhouette Score used for comparison showed differences in performance.

💡 Insights

K-Means is better for structured data with clear boundaries.

DBSCAN is ideal when clusters have varying densities or shapes.

Combining both helps in understanding data from multiple angles.
